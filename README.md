# ml_cpp

The purpose of this project is to get better at c++ while better understanding the underlying math behind a lot of machine learning models we take for granted. I really love sklearn, so I'm going to try to keep the syntax somewhat similar to that. 


To do:
1. SVM
2. RFC / RFR
3. CV
4. KMeans
5. Scaler
