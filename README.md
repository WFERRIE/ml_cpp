# ML_CPP
Welcome to ml_cpp, a personal project aimed at creating a simple but powerful machine learning library in c++. Drawing inspiration from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), this library is designed for ease of use, modularity, and extensibility.

## Features
### Classification
- Logistic Regression with Regularization
- Support Vector Machines [in progress]

### Regression
- Linear Regression with Regularization
- Random-Forest Regressor [in progress]

### Metrics
- accuracy_score
- confusion_matrix
- f1_score
- precision_score
- recall_score
- max_error
- mean_absolute_error
- mean_squared_error

### Preprocessing
- standard_scaler
- minmax_scaler

### Utilities
- read_csv
- dataset class
- cross_validation [in progress]
