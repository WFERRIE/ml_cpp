# ML_CPP
Welcome to ml_cpp, a personal project aimed at creating a simple but powerful machine learning library in c++. Drawing inspiration from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), this library is designed for ease of use, modularity, and extensibility.

Please see [here](https://github.com/WFERRIE/ml_cpp/tree/main/docs) for documentation.
